Easy and short application for DMT interpretation. In future it will draw graphs too.

# DMT
The Flat dilatometer, or DMT, is an in-situ device used to determine the soil in-situ lateral stress and soil lateral stiffness and to estimate some other engineering properties of subsurface soils. It is a relatively simple test and its use in geotechnical investigations becomes more and more common. However, it is not yet as common as Standard Penetration Test and Cone Penetration Test in geotechnical investigation.
